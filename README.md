# Business-Insights-360

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is a consumer electronics company expanding rapidly but is not able to compete with other companies using data as most of their report still exists in Excel. Now they have decided to implement the data analytics using PowerBi in their company for the first time to surpass their competitors in the market and to make data driven decisions. My goal is to implement an advanced analytics solution using Power BI that will enable the company to get insights and make informed decisions.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics PowerBi Course, Link to the course is [here](https://codebasics.io/courses/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project)

## Company’s back ground

AltiQ hardware is a company which has grown vastly in the recent years, and opened business all over the globe. It is a company which sells, computer and computer accessories through three mediums/channel

- Retailers
- Direct
- Distributors

Recently the company has faced a unforeseen loss by opening store in America based on the surveys, intuition and some excel analysis and also the company’s competitors has handful of analytics team to perform analysis and make data driven decision. So, the AltiQ hardware has no other option other than building their analytics team for data driven insights and decisions in the future to survive better in the industry. 

### Questions to ask before starting with dashboard

- What is the objective of building this PowerBi dashboard?
- In what terms the success of this project will be measured?
- What will be time dead-line of the project?
- do the stakeholders expecting pre-view before the actual release?
- What are all the hopes stakeholders have out of this project?
- what are all fears the stakeholder have in terms of building this dashboard?
- Who are all will be using this dashboard and for what purpose?
- what are all expectation the stakeholders have, by the completion of this project?
- What can go wrong while building this project?
- what are all the resources/ data needed to build this dashboard?
- Is there any inputs from stakeholders in terms of design and views of the dashboard?

After the project kick off meetings, the data engineering team has given the data as per the request of data analytics team.

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.

## Importing data into PowerBi

- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential
